## End-to-End Workflow Execution Latency (Cold)

This experiment measures the end-to-end execution latency for each of the
implemented workflows.

### Run the experiment

First, make sure you have [deployed the different baselines](FIXME).

Then, you may run the different baselines:

```bash
invrs eval e2e-latency-cold run --baseline knative --baseline cc-knative [--debug]
```

Lastly, just run the results:

```bash
invrs eval e2e-latency-cold plot
```

you should get something like the following:
